# Duo

Duo is my own project, a mobile aplication for android.

It is a platform for weddings, where engaged couples can buy and edit their own personalized "event" and share it with their guests.

Some features available for each event are:

• Pre-wedding video presentation

•	Date of the wedding and a real-time countdown

•	Photo album presented in a slideshow format

•	History about the groom and bride

•	Groomsman and Bridesmaid presented in an infinite carrousel format

•	Information about the wedding and the location with local name, address, picture, and map

•	Area to write and see messages destined to the groom and bride

•	Area to post and see pictures from everyone who have access to the event

•	Acknowledgement page

•	Area for gifts in form of donations*
