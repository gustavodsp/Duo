        <item>Duo is a platform geared towards weddings. Our goal is to host several events across Ireland and around the world. Each wedding has a different Duo version, accessible through a name or number assigned by the bride and groom.</item>
        <item>Login and click on ‘Product‘ button to purchase a Duo version dedicated to your wedding. We have simplified the acquisition process as much as possible so that in just a few minutes you are able to have your own Duo version.</item>
        <item>We are always looking to innovate and add new features on our platform. As of right now, the app offers several features, such as photo and message feeds, honeymoon gifts, pre wedding photos and videos, information about the ceremony and much more!</item>
        <item>We want the bride and groom to feel safe when using our app, so we ask all users to register. That way we can easily identify them. DON’T WORRY, we also hate spams. Your email will be safe with us.</item>
        <item>No. Guests can access events and interact within them free of charge. They will just need the event code for that.</item>
